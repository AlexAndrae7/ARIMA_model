Run_Arima_model       is the file that calls all functions and actually runs the code. Change/Customize everything you need here. Explanations will also be found here.
my_arima_functions    contains all the functions regarding the model that are needed in Run_Arima_model, don't need to change anything here
my_functions          contains all other needed functions, don't need to change anything here
NH_SEA_Ice_Extent     is an example file, when you don't change anything, the code should run fine. (except the file path etc), data can be found here: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/
